    <h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>

    <p>
      This SRFI defines a mechanism for defining auxiliary syntax
      keywords independently in different modules in such a way that
      they still have the same binding so that they can be used
      interchangeably as literal identifiers in
      <code>syntax-rules</code> and <code>syntax-case</code> expressions
      and can be both imported under the same name without conflicts.
    </p>

    <h2 id="issues">Issues</h2>

    <p>None at present.</p>

    <h2 id="rationale">Rationale</h2>

    <p>
      Literal identifiers in <code>syntax-rules</code>
      and <code>syntax-case</code> expressions match another
      identifier if and only if both identifiers have the same lexical
      binding or if both identifiers are the same and both have no
      lexical binding.  This equivalence relation is the same as the
      one defined by <code>free-identifier=?</code> from R4RS and
      R6RS.
    </p>

    <p>
      Macro writers that need these literal identifiers as part of
      specific surrounding forms have therefore two choices.  Either
      they match against a bound or against an unbound identifier.
    </p>

    <p>
      Matching against an unbound identifier is problematic because
      an unbound identifier cannot be renamed.
    </p>

    <p>
      Usually, as in the derived forms defined in R6RS and R7RS, the
      literal identifiers are therefore bound.  Their bindings are
      called auxiliary syntax in R6RS and R7RS.  They are bound to a
      unique transformer for that syntax.  In other words, two
      identifiers naming auxiliary syntax match
      (are <code>free-identifier=?</code>) if and only if they are
      bound to the same transformer.
    </p>

    <p>
      This has a different kind of problem.  Often, the names for
      auxiliary syntax are either short common words
      (like <em>else</em>) or simple symbolic identifiers
      (like <em>=&gt;</em>).  Therefore, independent libraries may
      each export an auxiliary keyword but all with the same name.  This is
      problematic when the bindings are not mutually the same (that
      is, the identifiers are not <code>free-identifier=?</code>).
    </p>

    <p>
      This SRFI defines therefore a mechanism for independent
      libraries to independently export auxiliary syntax that has
      mutually the same bindings.
    </p>

    <p>
      If syntax parameters are supported, this auxiliary syntax is a
      syntax parameter so that it can be updated hygienically
      through <code>syntax-parameterize</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
      This SRFI also defines a facility for defining auxiliary syntax in
      the above sense lexically locally.  This can be used to
      auxiliary syntax back into scope and can be interesting for
      macro writers.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the mailing list
      to <a href="https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-177/srfi-177.html">SRFI
      177</a>, the idea of hygienic keywords (where keywords are
      understood in the sense of SRFI 177) has been discussed.
      Arguments in favor of hygienic keywords were the avoidance of
      any runtime overhead and that they bring in all the advantages
      of the usual Scheme macro hygiene.  One argument against
      hygienic keywords was that independent libraries may want to
      independently export hygienic keywords under the same name
      without conflicts.  That is now possible with this SRFI.
    </p>

    <h3>Examples</h3>

    <h4>Matching of literal identifiers</h4>

    <p>
      The following expression</p> <pre>(let* ()
  (define-auxiliary-syntax foo foo)
  (define-syntax is-foo?
    (syntax-rules (foo)
      ((_ foo) #t)
      ((_ _) #f)))
  (let* ()
    (is-foo? foo)))</pre> <p>evaluates to <code>#t</code> as does the
    expression</p> <pre>(let* ()
  (define-auxiliary-syntax foo foo)
  (define-syntax is-foo?
    (syntax-rules (foo)
      ((_ foo) #t)
      ((_ _) #f)))
  (let* ()
    (define-auxiliary-syntax bar foo)
    (is-foo? bar)))</pre>

    <p>
      On the other hand,</p> <pre>(let* ()
  (define-auxiliary-syntax foo foo)
  (define-syntax is-foo?
    (syntax-rules (foo)
      ((_ foo) #t)
      ((_ _) #f)))
  (let ()
    (define-syntax foo (syntax-rules ()))
    (is-foo? foo)))</pre>
      <p>evaluates to <code>#f</code>.
    </p>

    <h4>Importing from the magic library <code>(srfi 206 all)</code></h4>

    <p>
      The library declaration</p>
      <pre>(import (rename (only (srfi 206 all) foo bar) (bar baz)))</pre>
      <p>is (apart from the binding of
      the <code>define-auxiliary-syntax</code> identifier) equivalent to
      the library declarations</p>
      <pre>(import (srfi 206))
(begin
  (define-auxiliary-syntax foo foo)
  (define-auxiliary-syntax baz bar))</pre>

    <h4>Syntax parameters</h4>

    <p>
      When auxiliary syntax is <code>syntax-parameterize</code>d, its
      identity (as far as <code>free-identifier=?</code> is concerned)
      does not change.
    </p>

    <p>
      For example, the following expression</p>
<pre>
(syntax-parameterize
    ((unquote
      (syntax-rules ()
        ((_ e) (eval e (environment '(scheme base)))))))
  (let ((x '(+ 1 2)))
    (list `,x ,x)))</pre> <p>evaluates to
      <code>((+ 1 2) 3)</code>.
    </p>

    <h2 id="specification">Specification</h2>

    <h3>Syntax</h3>

    <p>
      This SRFI defines one syntax binding
      form, <code>define-auxiliary-syntax</code>.
    </p>

    <p><code>(define-auxiliary-syntax ⟨keyword⟩ ⟨symbol⟩)</code></p>

    <p>
      This form is a definition that can be used wherever syntax
      definitions are allowed.
    </p>

    <p>
      The <code>⟨keyword⟩</code> is
      bound to (auxiliary) syntax named by <code>⟨symbol⟩</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
      A <code>⟨keyword⟩</code> bound
      through <code>define-auxiliary-syntax</code> has the same
      binding as another identifier (that is, they
      are <code>free-identifier=?</code>) if and only if the other
      identifier is also bound
      through <code>define-auxiliary-syntax</code> and with the same
      name.
    </p>

    <p>
      In a Scheme supporting syntax parameters
      (see <a href="https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-139/srfi-139.html">SRFI
	139</a>), the auxiliary syntax are syntax parameters.
    </p>

    <h3>Libraries</h3>

    <p>
      This SRFI defines two libraries, <code>(srfi 206)</code>
      and <code>(srfi 206 all)</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
      The <code>define-auxiliary-syntax</code> keyword is (the sole
      identifier) exported by the library <code>(srfi 206)</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
      The library <code>(srfi 206 all)</code> is a (magic) library that
      can, in import sets, only be referenced in the form <code>(only
      (srfi 206 all) ⟨identifier⟩…)</code>.  This import set imports
      the <code>⟨identifiers⟩</code>, each bound at top-level as if
      through <code>define-auxiliary-syntax</code>, to auxiliary syntax
      with the respective name.
    </p>

    <h3>Interoperability</h3>

    <p>
      In a Scheme implementation supporting this SRFI, all auxiliary
      syntax, in particular the
      identifiers <code>else</code>, <code>=&gt;</code>, <code>unquote</code>,
      <code>unquote-splicing</code>, <code>_</code>, <code>...</code>
      defined in <code>(scheme base)</code> behave as if defined
      through <code>define-auxiliary-syntax</code> with their
      respective names.
    </p>

    <p>
      Syntax parameters that have no sensible initial binding
      (like <code>yield</code>
      of <a href="https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-190/srfi-190.html">SRFI
	190</a>) shall be bound through <code>define-auxiliary-syntax</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
      It is recommended to maintain a list of auxiliary syntax used by
      Scheme standards and
      implementations <a href="https://registry.scheme.org/">at the
      Scheme Registry</a>.
    </p>

    <h2 id="implementation">Implementation</h2>

    <p>This SRFI cannot be implemented portably in R6RS or R7RS alone.
      A complete sample implementation is provided by
      the <a href="https://www.unsyntax.org">Unsyntax implementation
      of the Scheme programming language</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      A portable, but incomplete poor man's solution is
      provided <a href="https://github.com/scheme-requests-for-implementation/srfi-206/tree/master">in
      the repository</a>.  It will be expanded over time while a
      registry of auxiliary keywords is being built and while native
      implementations are catching up.
    </p>

    <p>
      While this SRFI cannot be implemented in a portable way, in view
      of the existence of the portable poor man's implementation of
      the library <code>(srfi 206 all)</code>, users that aim for
      maximal portability are adviced to solely import the
      library <code>(srfi 206 all)</code> as long as they do not need
      the extra features from the library <code>(srfi 206)</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
      In
      the <a href="https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Syntactic-Abstraction%3A-The-syntax-case-expander-Dybvig/ae30b441f2223200562635217a3927dbe9b99604?p2df">original
      syntax model of the syntax-case expander by R. Kent Dybvig et
      al.</a> two bound identifiers are <code>free-identifier=?</code>
      if and only if their associated labels are the same.  An
      implementation following this model can designate special
      labels, one for each symbol, naming auxiliary syntax.  Whenever
      auxiliary syntax with some name is defined the defined
      identifier will be labelled with such a special label.  When
      such a a label is looked up, a suitable transformer is returned,
      which can be created on the fly.
